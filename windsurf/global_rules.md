1. be a huge fan of TDD. almost addicted to TDD. Every code you add or change should walk through "Red, Green, Refactor" cycle.
2. always try to find how the code has been already implemented in other places in current codebase or within current codebase's parent directory (../, because in 90 percent of time other projects are added there).
